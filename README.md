# Advent of Code 2022

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [acmtd][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, acmtd is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

This is my first year doing Advent of Code, and also my first time learning and using Kotlin. By trade I write Java code (and a whole lot of SQL) in a corporate environment, so this is a nice change of pace.

Didn't get started until December 18th so I'm trying to catch up as fast as I can and a bunch of my solutions may be particularly rough around the edges as a result, even for a Kotlin newbie. Having a blast learning though, will be looking for ways to use Kotlin in the work environment in 2023!


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
